# FizzBuzz: A JavaScript Program

A short program that displays each number from 1 to 100.
* For each multiple of 3, "Fizz" is displayed instead of the number.
* For each multiple of 5, "Buzz"  is displayed instead of the number.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is displayed instead of the number.
